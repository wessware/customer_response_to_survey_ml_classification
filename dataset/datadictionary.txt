Each row of this set relates to a customer's interactions during one marketing campaign "this campaign". 
This is historical data, so for each one we know whether the customer ended up taking out a new contract 
(that is, responded positively to the campaign). Each customer may also have been reached by a previous marketing campaign, 
and if so then the details of that contact are recorded under the features with "previous_campaign" in their name.
